            <h2 style="color:rgb(51,11,51)">Halloween</h2>
            <p>During halloween, anyone can be anything. Whether someone dresses up as a spooky ghost, a nurse, or some niche character from a movie filmed in the 80's, every costume is unique and says things about every person! My family was never the type for themed group costumes, though I am doing those with a friend this year. I'm going as Hermes, and she's going as Apollo!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Fourth of July</h2>
            <p>Fireworks, slightly overcooked hotdogs drowned in ketchup, sprinklers, and family. I love the fourth of July for the same reason many people do: spending time with family, the beautiful skies, and the food.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>My Birthday</h2>
            <p><i>Obviously</i> the one holiday that should be celebrated around the world, my Birthday! I always have rollerskating parties on my birthdays, and I plan on keeping it that way. My birthday is also coming up as I'm making this (november 8th)!</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Thanksgiving</h2>
            <p>"I wonder why Ell loves Thanksgiving," I hear you say through this computer screen, and <i>of course</i> it's because of the food! My personal favorite either has to be the mac n' cheese, or the mashed potatos and gravy, heavily based on the texture of the gravy.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>New Years</h2>
            <p>While being right next to my least favorite holiday: Christmas, I <b>love</b> New Years! It's fun, casual, and you can watch the countdown til the next year arrives. I don't ever really get the hang of writing the new correct date on my assignments until around May, though.</p>
