                <h3>Main Info</h3>
                <h4><i>Don't Stress Meowt</i> is a cat cafe, with a location local to me! I've had my recent birthday here, along with a visit for my sister's birthday. The cats are very friendly, as well as the staff, and the service is amazing! The food is amazing as well, my favorite cafe food being their Mochi Taiyaki (as is pictured in the other side) that come in different cat shapes, freshly baked with different options for filling. My favorite cafe drink from there is their hot cocoa, which is very thick and chocolatey.</h4>
