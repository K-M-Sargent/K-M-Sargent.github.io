            <h4>Doctor Who consists of two main eras: Classic Doctor Who--1963 to 1989, and New Doctor Who (also often referred to as NuWho)--2009 to current. There have been 15 Doctors, with the actor of the 16th Doctor having been announced already. The first 8 Doctors were in Classic Doctor Who, and the rest have been in NuWho, with the actor David Tennant making reappearances multiple times throughout NuWho, first as the Tenth Doctor (likely the most popular one). But which is my favorite? The Eleventh and Twelth Doctors, played by Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi!</h4>
