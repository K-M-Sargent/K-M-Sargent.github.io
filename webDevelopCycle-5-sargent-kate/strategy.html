In order to successfully create a website, and a good-looking, working one at that, you need to plan. If you successfully finished the last step, you should know what you need on the website. Summarize your information, check to see how many paragraphs you have, what you want to include (words, pictures, lists, etc.) and plan out how you want to build the website, which is a process that will look different for everyone.</p>

                <h2>Common Questions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Why should I come up with a strategy first?" As it is with many of these seemingly-optional steps in this process, you can function and make a "website" without this step, but the website may not work, will likely be extremely stressful to make, and it <i>will</i> be obvious to people that you didn't do this step (which could end up in less people viewing your website).</li>
                    <li>"What would an average strategy look like?" This varies largely, but steps such as the ones in this website are common, and you can divide it up even more and add steps if needed to make your website work both for you and your viewers.</li>
