            <p>Cheesecake, a beautiful and equally tastey desert loved by many, even lactose intolerant people (like me). Cream cheese, strawberry toppings, a bottom that is usully made of graham crackers, and the best taste ever made. I think (I would put "know" but some <i>insane</i> people disagree with me) that this is the best dessert for multiple factors, including but not limited to: diveristy (cheesecake can range in toppings and flavors), not being too expensive nor cheap, and how it is an occasion food--making it often  related to specific memories.</p>
